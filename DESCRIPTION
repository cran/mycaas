Description: Implementation of adaptive assessment procedures based
    on Knowledge Space Theory (KST, Doignon & Falmagne, 1999 <ISBN:9783540645016>) and Formal Psychological Assessment
    (FPA, Spoto, Stefanutti & Vidotto, 2010 <doi:10.3758/BRM.42.1.342>) frameworks. An adaptive assessment is a type of evaluation that
    adjusts the difficulty and nature of subsequent questions based on the
    test taker's responses to previous ones. The package contains functions
    to perform and simulate an adaptive assessment. Moreover, it is
    integrated with two 'Shiny' interfaces, making it both accessible and
    user-friendly.  The package has been partially funded by the European Union -
    NextGenerationEU and by the Ministry of University and Research (MUR),
    National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission 4, Component 2,
    Investment 1.5, project “RAISE - Robotics and AI for Socio-economic
    Empowerment” (ECS00000035).
